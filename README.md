# GCode-to-ABB
A python implementation for transforming a GCode file to a ABB robot specific movements.

## Introduction
This repository contains a Python script that generates the points and movement commands for ABB robots from a GCode of a 2D object.

## How to use
Just open the script and type the GCode filename you want to convert. As a result you will obtain a single file containing all the points and the lineal movements that will be performed by the robot. You just should load these lines to your ABB robotÂ´s program and call it.

## Example
<p align="center">
  <img src="Examples/ABB robot drawing.gif"  alt="ABB robot drawing.gif" width=400><br/>
  <i> Result of the script </i>
</p>

## Future functionalities
In the current version, the script only parses `G00` and `G01` (linear movements). In future releases I would like to add more GCode commands (such as `G02`, `G03` (arc movements) and `G04` (dwell)).

## Requirements
You should install the following:

* Python
* Matplotlib
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Mpl_toolkits

## For Developers and coders!
I am aware that some parts could be optimized or are redundant for such small program. However I decided to make it as easy and simple as possible for anybody who is new to programming.
